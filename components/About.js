        <p class="text-muted mb-4">
          I'm a passionate developer currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in
          Computer Science at Midlands State University. My journey into technology
          began at the age of 16 when I built my first websiteâ€”an experience that
          sparked a deep interest in software development and digital innovation.
          Since then, I've been actively learning and building projects to sharpen
          my skills in web development, programming, and emerging technologies.
          I'm driven by curiosity, creativity, and a desire to make meaningful
          contributions through code.
        </p>
        <p class="text-muted">
          When I'm not coding, you can find reading sci-fi novels, or experimenting with new
          programming languages and frameworks.
